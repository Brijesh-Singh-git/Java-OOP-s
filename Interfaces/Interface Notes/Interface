Interface 

-Multiple Iheritance cannot be achived that why we use Interface to achieve the Multiple Inheritance.
-Interface is a "BLUE PRINT" of class.

synatx:-

1) It is a Blue Print of class

interface Test1
{
//variables
//methods
} 


2) Interface contains only static and final variables, abstract methods(by default) 
3) In Interface by default methods are public.
4) In interface methods are by default abstract.(i.e. it only allows abstract methods)
	whatever methods we create inside the interface, all those methods needs to be implemented in the child class.

Abstract:--> a method which have only definition but not implementation.

ex:-  void m1(); 


interface Test1
{
	void m1(); //abstract method
}  

class Exam implements Test{

	void m1()
	{
		//implement the body
	}
	} 
	


5) We cannot instantiate interface

Test1 t1 = new Test1(); // not valid 
Test1 t1 = new Exam(); // valid ---- we need to instiantiate using Class name
